<h1>Thinking Inside the box</h1>
<p class="description">When you are styling a web page with css page you must start to think in terms of <b>boxes</b>.
</p>
<p>Each element is treated as if it generates a new box.Each box can have new rules associated with it.</p>

<p>As you can see from the diagram above,each box has a <b>border</b>.
    Between the content and the border you can have <b>padding</b>,and outside of the border you can have a
    <b>margin</b> to separate this box from any neighboring boxes.</p>
